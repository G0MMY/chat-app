# Chat App


This web-based chat application allows different users to send messages between themselves. Each user can create a chat room, join one and have multiple rooms. I am currently building a mobile app to go with this web app.  


My objective while doing this application was to teach myself how to do a full stack project and to understand how channels works. It made me learn a lot about Django and, mostly, about the implementation of the backend of a web application. 


## Installation

*Download the source code
*Run sudo docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5
*Run python manage.py runserver
*cd in frontend
*Run npm install
*Run npm run dev

## How does it work


First, login

If you don't have an account, create one

At this point, you will be in the user room. You can enter one of your rooms, leave a room, join an existing room or create a new room.

If you go in a chat room, you can send messages to other users or delete your own messages. You can also see the date when they were sent and from whom.

If you want to create a room, only enter itâ€™s name
